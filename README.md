# Unity_Webcam
# LiveSketch – OpenCV + Unity (C#)

This is a small exploratory project demonstrating basic C# scripting
inside Unity using OpenCvSharp for real-time image processing.

## Project Overview
- C# class inheritance and method overrides
- Unity lifecycle methods (`Awake`)
- Interfacing Unity textures with OpenCV matrices
- Basic computer vision pipeline:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Gaussian blur
  - Canny edge detection
  - Binary thresholding

## Purpose
This project was created as a learning exercise to:
- Practice C# syntax and structure
- Understand how Unity integrates with external libraries
- Explore real-time computer vision concepts in an interactive environment

This is **not** a production-ready Unity application, but a focused
technical demo.
